## Docify

Docify is used for adding code samples directly into documentation. This tool does the following:

1. Parses the file path and file name from any `.md` files.
2. Downloads those snippets and emulates the correct directories for all docify needs
3. Docify's `compile_markdown!` is run on all affected files, and derives snippets from each
   downloaded file
4. Emulated directories are deleted and cleaned up
