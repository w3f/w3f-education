title: Parachain Architecture Overview
---

Before beginning the journey to starting your parachain, it's important to realize how exactly the notion of a parachain fits into the wider architecture of Polkadot.  

Note that we will be using Polkadot binaries and dependencies, as indicative later, but we will be provisioning and locally running our own relay chain.  We will also create and run our own parachain, which will connect to our relay chain.
