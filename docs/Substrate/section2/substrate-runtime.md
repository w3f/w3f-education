description: Learn what the runtime in Substrate is, and how it defines a state transition function.
---

The runtime is the heart of our blockchain. It defines precisely how our blockchain will handle new
data, whether it will react to a change in the network's state, and communicates with storage and
networking layers as needed. Each runtime is a Wasm Virtual Machine. It is possible to update
runtime by modifying/replacing Wasm VM, which enables forkless upgrades on Substrate Blockchains to
be possible.

 end
```

It is also responsible for ensuring the validity of extrinsics, can compile Wasm code for forkless
upgrades, and, most importantly for us â€” facilitates the usage of FRAME (**Framework for Runtime
Aggregation of Modularized Entities**) to build and add pallets. You can think of the runtime as the
**engine** that facilitates the outer node (that ends up interacting with other nodes over the
network) and storage to communicate, process, then store changes.

:::note

Because the runtime compiles to a **Wasm** environment, it is also a `no_std` environment. For this
reason, not all external Rust crates will work with a runtime unless they can work in a `no_std`
environment.

## The Outer Node

The outer node refers to the portion of a Substrate node that deals with peer-to-peer networking and
receiving new incoming requests from nodes. Using **host functions**, it can pass this data as an
opaque blob that is then decoded and processed by the runtime, where it is then stored in the
underlying storage layer.
