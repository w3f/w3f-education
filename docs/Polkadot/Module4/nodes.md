# Nodes on Polkadot Network

The Polkadot relay chain network consists of nodes and roles. Nodes are the network-level enti-
ties physically executing the Polkadot software, and roles are protocol-level entities
performing a particular purpose. Nodes may perform multiple roles.
On the network level, the relay chain is open. Any node may run the software and participate
as any of these types of nodes:

- Light client: retrieves certain user-relevant data from the network. The availability of light
clients is irrelevant. They don't perform a service for others.
- Full node: retrieves all types of data, stores it long-term, and propagates it to others. Must
be highly available.
