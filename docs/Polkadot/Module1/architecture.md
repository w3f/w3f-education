# Architecture of Polkadot

Polkadot utilises a central chain called the relay chain which communicates with mul-
tiple heterogeneous and independent sharded chains called parachains (parallel
chains). The relay chain is responsible for providing shared security for all parachains, as well as
trust-free interchain transactability between parachains. In other words, the issues that Polkadot
aims to address are those discussed above: interoperability, scalablility, and weaker security due
to splitting the security power.
