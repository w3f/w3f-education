# OpenZeppelin Template

[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) has a steep learning curve. In order to
make it easier for newcomers to get started, OpenZeppelin is providing a generic template that can
be used to quickly bootstrap a Polkadot parachain project.

Along with the templates, OpenZeppelin also provides a
[documentation website](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/substrate-runtimes/1.0.0/) that explains how
to add or deduct all the common pallets on your prospective parachain project.

:::tip Example Parachain Project - Educhain

[Educhain](https://github.com/w3f/educhain) is developed using
[OpenZeppelin Generic Runtime Template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/polkadot-generic-runtime-template).

:::

## Personalizing the Template - Rebranding to your project name

Search and replace every instance of `parachain-template` to your `project-name` and
`parachain_template` to your `project_name`. This should help rebrand the template to your project
name in all of the key locations.
